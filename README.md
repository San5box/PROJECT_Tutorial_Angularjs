# PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs
Angular-Tutorialâ€” the tutorial for AngularJS
This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

The tutorial contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the AngularJS framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

## Getting Started
To get you started you can simply clone the ```PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs``` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites ``` PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs  ```
You need git to clone the ``` PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs repository```. You can get git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test ```PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs```. You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Clone ```PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs  ```
Clone the ```PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs  ``` repository using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/San5box/PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs.git
cd PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs
```
If you just want to start a new project without the ```PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs``` commit history then you can do:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/San5box/PROJECT_Tutorial_Angularjs.git <your-project-name>

```
The ```depth=1``` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.
